# r/place Project
## Developers
Created by Lorenz Boss, Tobias Topp, Levin Fankhauser and Cem Akkaya

## Inspiration 
Our web application is inspired by the well-known r/place event on Reddit. 
The aim of the event is to place a pixel on a canvas every five minutes. The whole world can take part and after a while colonies are formed that fight against each other.

## Information
In our application you can also place pixels on a Canva, but you don't have to wait five minutes, just 10 seconds.
