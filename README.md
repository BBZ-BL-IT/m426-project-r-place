# r/place Project
## Developers
Created by Lorenz Boss, Tobias Topp, Levin Fankhauser and Cem Akkaya

## Inspiration 
Our web application is inspired by the well-known r/place event on Reddit. 
The aim of the event is to place a pixel on a canvas every five minutes. The whole world can take part and after a while colonies are formed that fight against each other.

## Information
In our application you can also place pixels on a Canva, but you don't have to wait five minutes, just 10 seconds.

## implementation
We have implemented our latest project with Next.js. Next.js is an advanced framework that helped us to build a modern and powerful web application.

Supabase impressed us with its easy integration and many features. The real-time features and user-friendly authentication made the work much easier.

Another important part of our project is the implementation of live server rendering. This makes our application load extremely fast and provides a great user experience. The benefits of Live Server Rendering are better SEO and faster page load times.
