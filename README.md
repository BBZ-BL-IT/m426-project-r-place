# r/place Project
## Developers
Created by Lorenz Boss, Tobias Topp, Levin Fankhauser and Cem Akkaya

Our web application is inspired by the well-known r/place event on Reddit.

## Information
In our application you can also place pixels on a Canva, but you don't have to wait five minutes, just 10 seconds.

## implementation
We are pleased to inform you that we have successfully realized our latest project with Next.js. Next.js is an advanced framework that has enabled us to develop a modern and powerful web application.

Supabase impressed us with its simple integration and extensive functions, which made our work much easier. Particularly noteworthy are the real-time features and user-friendly authentication, which were seamlessly integrated into our application.

Another significant aspect of our project is the implementation of Live Server Rendering. This technology ensures that our application loads at lightning speed and provides an excellent user experience. The benefits of Live Server Rendering, such as improved SEO and faster page load times, have been
