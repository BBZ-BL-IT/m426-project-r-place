## r/place Project
<p>Created by Cem Akkaya, Lorenz Boss, Levin Fankhauser and Tobias Topp</p>

## Inspiration 
<p>Our web application is inspired by the well-known r/place event on Reddit. 
The aim of the event is to place a pixel on a canvas every five minutes. The whole world can take part and after a while colonies are formed that fight against each other.</p>


## Information 
<p>In our application you can also place pixels on a Canva, but you don't have to wait five minutes, just 10 seconds.</p>
